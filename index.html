			<h1>‚ú® Overview ‚ú®</h1>
			<p>
				Quantitative methods encompass a range of mathematical and statistical
				techniques utilized in various fields to analyze data, make predictions,
				and solve problems. They involve the use of numerical data and
				mathematical calculations to derive insights, make informed decisions,
				and conduct empirical research.

			<h2>üóùÔ∏è Key Areas:</h2>
			<h3>1. Descriptive Statistics:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Involves summarizing and describing datasets using measures like mean,
				median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Inferential Statistics:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Utilizes data samples to make inferences or predictions about larger
				populations. It involves hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and
				confidence intervals.
			</p>
			<h3>3. Correlation and Causation:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Explores relationships between variables. Correlation measures the
				strength of association, while causation explores cause-and-effect
				relationships.
			</p>
			<h3>4. Probability Theory:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Fundamental in quantifying uncertainty. It's used to predict the
				likelihood of events occurring and forms the basis of many statistical
				methods.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>üì¶ Applications:</h2>
			<h3>1. Business and Economics:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Used for market research, forecasting, risk analysis, and financial
				modeling.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Social Sciences:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Applied in surveys, psychology, sociology, and political analysis.
			</p>
			<h3>3. Science and Research:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Utilized for experiments, data analysis, and drawing conclusions in
				various scientific fields.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>üí° Importance:</h2>
			<h3>1. Decision Making:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Provides a basis for making informed decisions backed by empirical
				evidence.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Research and Analysis:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Enables rigorous analysis of data, providing valuable insights and
				conclusions.
			</p>
			<h3>3. Predictive Modeling:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Facilitates the creation of predictive models for forecasting and risk
				assessment.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>üéØ Limitations:</h2>
			<h3>1. Assumptions and Interpretation:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Results depend on the correctness of assumptions and the context in
				which they are applied.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Data Quality:</h3>
			<p class="subcontent">
				Quality of results is heavily dependent on the quality and relevance of
				the data used.
